### Project Summary: New-Onset Epilepsy (NOE) Pilot Study

**Objective:**  
The goal of this project was to analyze a pilot study dataset on new-onset epilepsy (NOE) to uncover demographic, clinical, and diagnostic patterns. The study aimed to identify variations in seizure types, age distribution, and associated comorbidities, providing insights into the management of NOE.

**Approach:**  
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**  
   - Loaded and cleaned the dataset to address missing values and ensure accuracy.  
   - Focused on key features like seizure types, age, neuroimaging abnormalities, and comorbidities.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Analyzed the prevalence of different seizure types (e.g., Generalized tonic-clonic, Absence seizures, Myoclonic seizures).  
   - Used SQL Programming and Python for EDA and Conducted statistical tests, including ANOVA, to compare age distributions across seizure types.  
   - Visualized age and seizure type associations using boxplots and descriptive statistics.

3. **Statistical Analysis:**  
   - Performed ANOVA to evaluate significant differences in age across seizure types.
   - Highlighted the relationship between metabolic imbalances, neuroimaging abnormalities, and seizure categories.

**Key Findings:**  
- **Prevalence:** Generalized tonic-clonic seizures were the most common type.  
- **Age Distribution:** Statistically significant differences were found in age distributions across seizure types (p-value: 6.01e-06).  
- **Neuroimaging Insights:** Abnormalities were prevalent across all seizure types, with notable variation in metabolic imbalances.  
- **Comorbidities:** Adults exhibited a wider range of age and comorbidities compared to children and adolescents, who showed less variability.

**Tools Used:**  
- **Programming Language:** Python (Jupyter Notebook), SQL   
- **Libraries for Data Analysis:** pandas, numpy, scipy.stats  
- **Visualization Libraries:** matplotlib, seaborn

**Recommendations:**  
1. **Tailored Diagnostics:** Emphasize personalized diagnostic approaches to address the variability in age and comorbidities.  
2. **Focused Treatment:** Develop treatment strategies targeting the most prevalent seizure type, Generalized tonic-clonic, and consider age-related factors.  
3. **Further Research:** Conduct larger studies to validate the patterns and findings observed in this pilot study.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This pilot study provides valuable insights into new-onset epilepsy, highlighting differences in seizure types, age distributions, and associated comorbidities. These findings underscore the need for tailored approaches in epilepsy diagnosis and treatment, paving the way for improved management of NOE cases.
